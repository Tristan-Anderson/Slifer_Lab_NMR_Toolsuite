I develop features in each branch of the repository.

I try to keep the main branch free of the insane number of commits I might make in a day.

I work on one feature at a time, which means that I also work on one branch at a time.
That beging said, the most recent commit you see to the repository is probably the code
that I'm working on currently. I generally do not push to this repository unless the
entire toolsuite is working.

Have fun!
