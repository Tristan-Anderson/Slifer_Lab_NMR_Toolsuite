I develop features in each branch of the repository.

I try to keep the main branch in a (sometimes fragile), but working state.

There is documentation in a pdf attached in this repo. Please read it.


asciigui.py is the file that you want to execute. should you want to see the depreciated
tkinter gui "gui.py" please checkout dd5f678183d06432a437c114b4eb973615f041a9. The last commit containing
the graphical interface.

Have fun!
