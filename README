I develop features in each branch of the repository.

I try to keep the main branch in a (sometimes fragile), but working state.

Each branch represents the development and implementation of each feature. I usually
work on one of these at a time.
The most recent commit you see to the repository is probably the code
that I'm currently working on.

Have fun!
